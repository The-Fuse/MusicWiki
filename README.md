## Requirements

For development, you will only need:

* Android Studio
* Android Device or Emulator installed along with Android Studio
* Minimum supported Android SDK


## Getting started

- [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html)
- Download the project 
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/The-Fuse/MusicWiki.git
```
- Open the project into Android Studio.
- Build the project and run the sample. You may need to update gradle and library versions. 
- Follow the guidance provided by Android Studio. 
- If you still not able to build the project try installing the [APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12uqeQaPSUW0FYD8_wuU6IIvXUXkXNgX_/view?usp=sharing) of the applicaiton


## Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services..
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - [Safe Args](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data#Safe-args) -  Safe Args generates simple object and builder classes for type-safe navigation and access to any associated arguments.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - For making networking request to api
